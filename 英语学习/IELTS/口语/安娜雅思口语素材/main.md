- 如果我觉得素材有错怎么办？
我们的素材都是经过店主 Anna 和外教一起编写和检查过的哦！ 您可以放心！
其实外国人在生活中有一些常用的口头上的表达，看起来很奇怪但实际并没有错的，国内老师也不会懂这些。所以呀！
如果你觉得素材有错，我们是非常欢迎您来询问我们滴！千万不要觉得不好意思哦！
下面举两个例子：
“Anna is two years my elder.” 安娜比我大两岁。 
“She is four months my younger” 她比我小四个月。
这是一种比较现代的说法，当然我们平时都会讲 
“ Anna is two years older than me” 和 “ She is four months younger than me.” 
但其实外国人都会用前者多一些的。
“The majority of the girls were content discussing about how handsome or how affluent[富裕的，富足的] their boyfriends were.” 
女孩子们都在热烈地讨论他们的男朋友有多帅。 
这是现代英语的另一个特征，
就是现在外国人在口头上都常常会省略掉介词。
这里就把 were content with discussing的 with 去掉了。
这在口语上是没问题的，但大家在写作中就尽量要避免哦。
```
Anna si two years my elder.
She is four months my younger.
Anna is two years older than me.
She is four months younger than me.
The majority of the girls were content discussing about how handsome or how affluent their boyfirends were.

2. Do you find it easy to organize your time at work?
   I find it quite easy to organize my time at work. I am fortunate enough to be able to work quite independently,

   so there are not a lot of group projects at my office. If I ever encounter a problem, I go to my boss, and they
   assist me.
